#' Goodman-Bacon decomposition
#'
#' bacon() is a function that perfroms the Goodman-Bacon decomposition for
#'  differences-in-differences with variation in treatment timing.
#'
#' @param formula a symbolic representation of the
#'  model to be fitted.
#' @param data a data.frame containing the variables in the model.
#' @param id_var character, the name of id variable for units.
#' @param time_var character, the name of time variable.
#' @param quiet logical, if TRUE does not print overal two-way fixed effects
#'  estimate or summary of 2x2 estimates by type.
